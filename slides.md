# C/C++ development with package managers

## Package manager

- from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager):
    > _a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner_

- types:
    - system package managers (e.g. `apt-get`, `yum`, `brew`, `chocolate`)
    - application package managers (e.g. VSCode Extension Manager)
    - development package managers

---

## Development package managers

- provide a simple way to obtain dependencies **in a reproducible manner**
    - support handling multiple versions of the same package
- provide a facility to update dependencies
- support resolving conflicts between dependencies
- **integrate well with the build system**
- reduce build times

---

## Other languages

- Python: `pip`, `easy_install`
- JavaScript: `npm`
- Java: `maven`, `gradle`
- Ruby: `gem`
- Rust: `cargo`
- C#: `nuget`

---

## C/C++

- main problem:
    - _build system integration_
    - no standard build system for C/C++

---

## C/C++ - current solutions

- [Conan](https://conan.io)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
- [hunter](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/)
- [buckaroo](https://buckaroo.pm)

---

## Buckaroo

- similar idea to [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), but focused on build
- tightly integrated with [buck build system](https://buck.build)
- very difficult to integrate packages not using _buck build_
- _package_ is simply a link to repository commit

---

## Hunter

- tightly integrated with [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- supports sharing binary cache
    - not _binary packages_
- still difficult to work with (but very promising project)
    - e.g. not supporting latest toolchains, such as [Android NDK r20](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/faq/android-studio.html#android-ndk-r19)
    - e.g. conflict resolution [must be done manually](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/creating-new/create/cmake-dependencies.html#conflict)

---

## Vcpkg

- backed by Microsoft
- currently under active development
- not yet [supporting multiple versions of the same package](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/4275)
- not yet [supporting specifying package versions in dependencies](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/1681)

---

## Conan

- backed by JFrog
- supports reproducible builds
- supports both binary and source packages
    - friendly for distribution of proprietary libraries
- not tied to any specific build system
    - but has [integrations](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/generators.html) to most popular ones (CMake, Autotools, Visual Studio, Xcode, Scons, ...)
- written in Python (installable via `pip`)

---

## Conan (continued)

- all dependencies specified in `conanfile.txt`
- example:

```txt
[requires]
opencv/4.1.1@conan/stable
boost/1.71.0@conan/stable

[options]
boost:header_only=True

[imports]
res, haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml -> .
```

---

## Conan - package installation

```txt
conan install /path/to/conanfile.txt [-g generator] [-s settings] [-o options]
```

or

```txt
conan install /path/to/conanfile.txt -pr profile
```

- generates an import file for specific build system using specified settings and options

---

# Conan demo https://github.com/DoDoENT/cpp-meetups/tree/master/001_conan

---

## Dependency overriding

- possible to override dependencies' dependencies
    - some rebuilds may be necessary, but conan handles this automatically
    - by default, this depends on Semantic Versioning
        - but custom logic can be specified per package
- if conflicts occur, conan installation fails
    - user needs to resolve it

---

## Creating conan packages

- create a `conanfile.py` file with:

```txt
conan new package-name/version
```

- (optionally) implement the `source` and `build` methods
- implement the `package` and `package_info` methods
- create the package with:

```txt
conan create /path/to/conanfile.py user/channel [-pr profile] [-s settings] [-o options]
```

---

## Template for conan package

```python
from conans import ConanFile, CMake, tools


class FacecameraConan(ConanFile):
    name = "face-camera"
    version = "0.1.0"
    license = "<Put the package license here>"
    author = "<Put your name here> <And your email here>"
    url = "<Package recipe repository url here, for issues about the package>"
    description = "<Description of Facecamera here>"
    topics = ("<Put some tag here>", "<here>", "<and here>")
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    options = {"shared": [True, False]}
    default_options = {"shared": False}
    generators = "cmake"

    def source(self):
        self.run("git clone https://github.com/conan-io/hello.git")
        # This small hack might be useful to guarantee proper /MT /MD linkage
        # in MSVC if the packaged project doesn't have variables to set it
        # properly
        tools.replace_in_file("hello/CMakeLists.txt", "PROJECT(HelloWorld)",
                              '''PROJECT(HelloWorld)
include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
conan_basic_setup()''')

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure(source_folder="hello")
        cmake.build()

        # Explicit way:
        # self.run('cmake %s/hello %s'
        #          % (self.source_folder, cmake.command_line))
        # self.run("cmake --build . %s" % cmake.build_config)

    def package(self):
        self.copy("*.h", dst="include", src="hello")
        self.copy("*hello.lib", dst="lib", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.dll", dst="bin", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.so", dst="lib", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.dylib", dst="lib", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.a", dst="lib", keep_path=False)

    def package_info(self):
        self.cpp_info.libs = ["hello"]
```

```python
    def source(self):
        self.run("git clone https://github.com/conan-io/hello.git")
        # This small hack might be useful to guarantee proper /MT /MD linkage
        # in MSVC if the packaged project doesn't have variables to set it
        # properly
        tools.replace_in_file("hello/CMakeLists.txt", "PROJECT(HelloWorld)",
                              '''PROJECT(HelloWorld)

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure(source_folder="hello")
        cmake.build()

        # Explicit way:

        self.copy("*.h", dst="include", src="hello")
        self.copy("*hello.lib", dst="lib", keep_path=False)

    def package_info(self):
        self.cpp_info.libs = ["hello"]
```

## Uploading packages

```txt
conan upload -r <remote> package/version@user/channel [--all]
```

- support for multiple remotes
- some remotes require authentication
- notable remotes:
    - [conan-center](https://bintray.com/conan/conan-center)
    - [conan-community](https://bintray.com/conan-community/conan)
    - [bincrafters](https://bintray.com/bincrafters/public-conan)

---

## Custom conan servers

- [conan-server](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/uploading_packages/running_your_server.html#running-your-server)
    - open source, reference implementation of conan protocol
- [Artifactory Community Edition for C/C++](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/uploading_packages/artifactory_ce.html#artifactory-ce)
    - free and easy to setup and maintain
    - lacks some more advanced feautes available in Artifactory Pro
- [Artifactory Pro](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+Comparison+Matrix)
    - commercial solution
    - high availability, replication, ...

---

# Conclusion

- development with package managers is easier
    - _focus on developing your code, not compiling 3rd party packages_
- multiple solutions for C and C++
- `conan` currently has most advantages
    - cross-platform
    - orthogonal to build system
    - decentralized
    - custom/private server instances
